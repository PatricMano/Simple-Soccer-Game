- This is a simulation program that simulates a two players kicking a ball with separate classes for player, field, and ball.
- Used random numbers for kick distance and direction while ensuring it gets reflected if it hits the field boundary.
- Simulated turn-based gameplay by allowing each player to alternatively kick the ball for a total of 20 turns.
- Displays the coordinates of the ball after each kick and information on if it was reflected or not.
